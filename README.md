## Core Concept

**Healing tattoos** combine:
- **Ancient therapeutic tattooing** traditions (dating back 5,300 years to Ötzi the Iceman)
- **Chinese medicine** principles (acupoint stimulation, meridian theory)
- **Stick-and-poke methodology** (hand-poked, meditative, less traumatic than machine tattoos)
- **Doula practices** (birth and death support)
- **Ritual and ceremony** (intentional, transformative experiences)

### Scientific Foundation

- 80% of Ötzi's 61 tattoos correspond to classical acupuncture points for pain relief
- Tattoos create sustained acupoint stimulation (comparable to electro-acupuncture)
- 89% overlap between myofascial meridians and acupuncture meridians
- Modern research (2024) validates therapeutic benefits for pain, grief processing, and trauma integration

## Practitioner Credentials

**JC Sharratt** brings a rare combination of expertise:
- PhD-level Chinese Medicine Doctor
- Fertility Specialist
- Death and Birth Doula
- Intuitive Stick-and-Poke Tattoo Artist

This unique intersection of skills enables truly integrative therapeutic tattooing that addresses physical, emotional, and spiritual dimensions of healing.

## Business Models

### Pricing Philosophy

- Memorial work is sacred, not transactional
- Sliding scale and compassionate pricing
- Never turn away client due to inability to pay
- Pro bono work as service
- Pay-it-forward community care model

### Service Tiers

**Compassionate Pricing** (Sliding Scale)
- Small memorial: $200-500
- For families experiencing financial hardship
- Payment plans available

**Standard Pricing**
- Small memorial: $400-600
- Medium memorial: $600-1,200
- Large memorial: $1,200-2,500+

**Integrated Packages**
- "Empty Arms, Full Heart": Bereavement doula support + memorial tattoo ($1,500-2,500)
- "Rainbow After Storm": Angel baby memorial + rainbow baby support ($3,000-5,000)

### Revenue Sustainability

- Memorial work: 2-4 tattoos/month (prevents burnout)
- Complementary virtual services: Doula support, fertility consultations, ear seed subscriptions
- Grant opportunities: Arts and healing, maternal health, grief support
- Community partnerships: Hospitals, fertility clinics, hospices

## Remote/Travel Practice Model

### High-Compatibility Services

The research identifies services most suitable for location-independent practice:

**⭐ Top Tier** (90% virtual delivery):
1. **Legacy Ink**: Virtual death doula support + travel for final tattoo session
2. **Touchstone Tattoo**: Virtual consult + pop-up clinic model
3. **Ear Seed Subscriptions**: Fully remote fertility support

**Hybrid Models**:
- "Anchor City + Circuit": Home base + quarterly visits to 6-8 cities
- "Retreat-Based": Clients travel to practitioner for intensive experiences
- "Virtual Practice + Strategic Travel": 60% virtual services, 30% travel tattoos, 10% retreats

### Regulatory Considerations

**Mobile Tattooing**:
- Varies widely by state/locality
- Some states prohibit (Maine)
- Some allow temporary permits (Kentucky: 7 days)
- Guest artist arrangements at licensed studios (easiest compliance)

**Doula Services**:
- Mostly unregulated (no state licensing required)
- Virtual doula care proven effective (2024 research)
- California, New York, Minnesota Medicaid covers telehealth doula services

**Financial Viability**:
- Low startup costs: $3,300-8,000
- Monthly fixed costs: $370-675
- Revenue potential: $20,000-30,000/month (hybrid model)
