        <div class="intro">
            Before you were born, before your baby's soul chose its brief path,
            there was an agreement. A sacred contract written in the stars.
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <p>
                I'm Jessica. Three times, my arms have been empty when they should have been full.
                Three times, I've asked the universe: Why? Why this pain? Why this loss?
            </p>

            <p>
                Evolutionary astrology gave me an answer that honored both the grief and the purpose.
                My babies' souls came briefly, by agreement, to crack me open. To initiate me as a
                wounded healer. To prepare me for this work—holding space for other bereaved parents
                seeking soul-level understanding of their losses.
            </p>

            <p>
                This is Chiron's path. The wound that becomes medicine. The loss that becomes service.

                The soul's journey across lifetimes. Your baby's brief incarnation wasn't random—it
                was chosen. Their soul came to teach something profound. To activate your evolution.

                        We read your baby's chart (yes, even miscarried babies have conception dates).
                        We explore the soul agreement between you. We understand their brief mission—what
                        they came to teach, what they came to activate in you. Then we create a memorial
                        tattoo that honors this sacred contract. Astrological symbols, chart placements,
                        nodal themes made permanent.

                        evolutionary purpose of your meeting. We place the tattoo at astrologically

            <p>
                <strong>Phase 1: Chart Reading</strong><br>
                We start with your baby's chart. Even early losses have conception dates we can work with.
                I read their chart through evolutionary lens—what was their soul's intention? What did
                they come to teach? How does this serve your evolution?
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Phase 2: Synastry Exploration</strong><br>
                How do your charts connect? What soul contracts exist between you? We explore the karmic
                themes, the evolutionary agreements, the profound purpose of your brief meeting.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Phase 3: Design + Timing</strong><br>
                We co-create tattoo design using astrological symbolism from the charts. We choose timing
                that's personally and cosmically significant. Your baby's birth/loss anniversary. Your
                Chiron return. Meaningful transits.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Phase 4: Ceremonial Tattooing</strong><br>
                Hand-poke method. Sacred space. We hold the soul contract in awareness as permanent ink
                meets your skin. Witness work. Transformation. The agreement honored in your body.

            <h3>This Isn't Toxic Spirituality</h3>
            <p>
                I'm not saying "everything happens for a reason" to dismiss your pain. I'm offering
                a soul-level framework that honors both the grief AND the evolutionary purpose.
                Your baby's death is devastating AND their soul came with intention. Both are true.

            <p>
                Three miscarriages shattered me. Then evolutionary astrology showed me the pattern in my chart—my
                Chiron placement, my nodal axis, the soul contracts I'd agreed to before birth. My babies came
                briefly to initiate me. To crack me open. To prepare me to hold this exact space for others.

                I'm a bereaved mother first. But I'm also: PhD in Chinese Medicine (understanding the body's
                energy). Evolutionary astrologer (reading soul contracts). Death doula (holding space for
                loss and transformation). Hand-poke tattoo artist (making soul agreements permanent).
            </p>

            <p>
                This combination doesn't exist anywhere else. Because it was born from my specific losses,
                my specific chart, my specific soul agreement to serve bereaved parents seeking cosmic
                understanding of their pain.
