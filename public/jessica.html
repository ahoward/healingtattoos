        <h1>Your baby's brief life<br>deserves permanent honoring</h1>

        <p class="lead">
            I'm Jessica. I've had three miscarriages. I understand the silence, the isolation,
            and the desperate need for something visible when everything invisible.
        </p>

        <p>
            One in four pregnancies end in loss. That's not a statistic when it's your baby.
            That's your empty arms, your silent nursery, your body that remembers what your
            calendar says shouldn't matter.
        </p>

        <p>
            I do memorial tattoo work for bereaved parents. Not as a business—as sacred work.
            Because I know what helps when people don't know what to say. Because your baby's
            existence matters, even if the world moved on too quickly. Because sometimes the
            only thing that makes sense is a permanent mark for a permanent hole in your heart.
        </p>

        <div class="spacer"></div>

        <p>
            I use hand-poke method—gentler, slower, more intentional. The sessions are private.
            You can bring whoever you need. We can talk about your baby or sit in silence.
            This isn't about pretty tattoos (though they're beautiful). This is about witnessing.
        </p>

        <p>
            I bring my training as a Chinese medicine doctor, fertility specialist, and death doula.
            But mostly I bring the knowledge of having been here myself. Of knowing that grief doesn't
            have a timeline, that your loss was real, that "at least you can get pregnant" helps no one.

            <h3>Early Pregnancy Loss</h3>
            <p>
                For babies the world never saw. Simple symbols, important dates, permanent proof they existed.
                No footprints from the hospital doesn't mean they didn't matter.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="offering">
            <h3>Stillbirth & Infant Death</h3>
            <p>
                Using actual footprints, handprints, names. For babies who were here—who had weight
                and warmth and a place in your arms, however briefly.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="offering">
            <h3>Failed Fertility Treatments</h3>
            <p>
                For embryos that didn't implant, cycles that failed, the version of yourself you thought
                you'd be. This loss is real too.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="offering">
            <h3>Rainbow Babies</h3>
            <p>
                When joy and grief live together. Honoring your angel baby while celebrating the one
                in your arms. Both stories matter.
            </p>
        </div>

        <blockquote>
            "Memorial tattoos don't fix grief. But they make invisible loss visible.
            They give you something to touch when you need to feel close."
        </blockquote>

        <div class="simple">
            <h2>How it works</h2>
            <p>
                We start with a free consultation. No pressure, just space to share your story.
                Tell me about your baby, your loss, what you need this to do.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sometimes people are ready right away. Sometimes they need time. Both are okay.
                When you're ready, we'll design together—your meaning, your symbols. Then we'll
                set up a session. It's ceremony as much as tattooing.
            </p>
            <p>
                I work with sliding scale pricing, always. Payment plans available. I will never
                turn someone away because money is tight. Packages range $400-2,500 depending on
                size and complexity, but I work with every situation.

            <h2>Location</h2>
            <p>
                I'm building this to be location-independent so I can serve bereaved parents everywhere.
                Right now: virtual consultations and design work (anywhere), plus periodic pop-up sessions
                in various cities. I can also travel to you for intensive sessions if that works better.

        <p>
            Memorial tattoos help with what researchers call "continuing bonds"—staying connected to
            your baby in new ways. They reduce isolation. They give back some control. Research backs
            this up, but you already know it in your body: permanent loss deserves permanent marking.
        </p>

        <p>
            This is early work for me—I'm just beginning to offer this publicly. But it comes from
            years of walking this path myself, years of professional training in Chinese medicine and
            death doula work, and a bone-deep understanding that bereaved parents need this.
