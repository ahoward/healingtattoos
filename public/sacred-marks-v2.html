            One in four pregnancies end in loss. If you're here, you know this isn't just a statistic.
        </div>

        <div class="statement">
            <p>
                I've walked this path. Three times, my arms have been empty when they should have been full.
                Three times, I've felt the silence, the isolation, the desperate need for something—anything—to
                make the invisible visible.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm Jessica. I'm a Chinese medicine doctor, a fertility specialist, and a death doula.
                But before any of that professional training, I'm a bereaved mother who understands
                what it means when people don't know what to say. When your loss doesn't get acknowledged.
                When you need your baby's brief existence to matter.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is why I do memorial tattoo work. Not as a business model, but as sacred work.
                Because I know what helps, and what doesn't. Because I know that sometimes the only thing
                that makes sense is a permanent mark for a permanent hole in your heart.

            <h2>What I Offer</h2>

            <p>
                This isn't about pretty tattoos (though they are beautiful). This is about making
                your baby real to a world that wanted to move on too quickly. This is about having
                something you can touch when the grief hits. This is about not being alone.
            </p>

            <ul class="simple-list">
                <li><strong>Pregnancy Loss & Miscarriage Memorial</strong> — For those of us who lost babies the world never saw. Simple symbols, dates that matter, permanent proof they existed.</li>

                <li><strong>Stillbirth & Infant Death Memorial</strong> — Using actual footprints, handprints, names. Honoring babies who were here, however briefly.</li>

                <li><strong>Failed IVF & Fertility Journey Memorial</strong> — For embryos that didn't make it, treatments that didn't work, the version of yourself you thought you'd be.</li>

                <li><strong>Rainbow Baby Honoring</strong> — When joy and grief live together. Holding space for both your angel baby and the one in your arms.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How This Works</h2>

            <p>
                First, we talk. Free consultation, no pressure, just space to share your story.
                I'll ask about your baby, your loss, what you need this tattoo to do for you.
                Sometimes people are ready right away. Sometimes they need time. Both are okay.
            </p>

            <p>
                I work with hand-poke (stick-and-poke) method. It's gentler, heals faster,
                and honestly, it feels more intentional. Less like getting tattooed, more like
                ceremony. The sessions are private. You can bring your partner, a friend, whoever
                you need. We can be silent or you can talk about your baby the whole time.
            </p>

            <p>
                I combine this with my training in Chinese medicine (therapeutic acupoint placement),
                death doula work (holding space for grief), and my own experience of loss.
                This isn't transactional. This is witnessing.

            <h2>What People Say</h2>

            <p style="font-style: italic; color: #999; margin-bottom: 30px;">
                (I'm just beginning this work publicly, but here's what I know from my own experience
                and from holding space with other bereaved parents:)
            </p>

            <p>
                Memorial tattoos don't fix grief. They don't bring babies back. But they do something
                important: they make the loss visible. They give you something to touch when you need
                to feel close. They tell the world "this happened, this mattered, this baby is mine."
            </p>

            <p>
                Research shows memorial tattoos help with continuing bonds—staying connected to your
                baby in a new way. They reduce isolation. They give you back some control in a
                situation where you had none.
            </p>

            <p>
                Mostly, they just help. And when you're drowning in grief, "helps" is enough.

            <h3>About Jessica</h3>

            <p>
                I'm a bereaved mom first, practitioner second. Everything I offer comes from that
                lived experience of pregnancy loss. But I also bring professional training that matters
                for this work:
            </p>

            <p>
                PhD in Chinese Medicine. I understand how acupoints work, how the body holds grief,
                how placement on meridians can support ongoing healing.
            </p>

            <p>
                Fertility specialist. I know the language of embryo grades and beta numbers and
                crushing disappointment. I've sat with patients through losses and held space for
                what comes next.
            </p>

            <p>
                Death doula. I'm trained to support people through dying and grief. I know how to
                witness loss without trying to fix it. I know how to hold ceremony.
            </p>

            <p>
                But really, I'm just someone who gets it. Who won't tell you "everything happens for
                a reason" or "at least you can get pregnant." Who knows that grief doesn't have a
                timeline and your baby's brief life deserves to be honored.

            <h2>A Note on Logistics</h2>

            <p>
                I'm building this practice to be location-independent. Right now, I offer virtual
                consultations and design sessions (I can serve you anywhere). For the actual tattoo,
                I can either travel to you for concentrated sessions, or we can plan for you to come
                to me during scheduled pop-up clinics in various cities.
            </p>

            <p>
                The memorial work side of this practice is sliding scale, always. Packages range from
                $400-2,500 depending on size and complexity, but I work with every budget. Payment plans
                available. Some families have funeral donations or baby shower money they redirect.
                Sometimes partners split it. Sometimes your support system contributes.
            </p>

            <p>
                Money should never be the barrier between you and honoring your baby.
