            Chiron is the asteroid that represents our deepest wound—the one that never fully heals,

        <div class="section">
            <p>
                I'm Jessica. Three miscarriages initiated me into Chiron's path. Each loss cracked me
                open a little more. Each empty womb taught me something I couldn't have learned any
                other way. Each baby's brief soul whispered: "This is your medicine. This pain will
                heal others."
            </p>

            <p>
                I fought it at first. I didn't want to be the wounded healer. I wanted to be a mother
                with living children. But my chart doesn't lie—my Chiron placement shows exactly this:
                loss as initiation, grief as teacher, wounding as preparation for sacred work.
            </p>

            <p>
                Now I understand. My three babies came briefly, by soul agreement, to prepare me to
                hold space for YOU. To witness your loss with the authority of someone who's been
                shattered. To offer evolutionary astrology readings that explain the soul purpose of
                your baby's brief incarnation. To create memorial tattoos that honor the sacred wound
                we share.

            <h3>The Chiron Initiation</h3>
            <p>
                In mythology, Chiron was a centaur wounded by a poisoned arrow. As an immortal, he couldn't
                die from the wound, but couldn't heal it either. He lived with chronic pain and became the
                greatest healer and teacher of his time—BECAUSE of his wound, not despite it.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
                That's us. Bereaved parents who can't "get over" our losses, but can transform them into
                medicine. The wound that won't heal becomes the source of healing we offer others.
            </p>
        </div>

            "Your wound is your medicine. Your loss is your initiation. Your baby's brief life

            <p>
                My Chiron is in [placement]. My chart showed me, with devastating clarity, that these three
                losses weren't random tragedy—they were my initiation. My babies' souls agreed, before birth,
                to come briefly and wound me in exactly the way my soul needed to be broken open.
            </p>

            <p>
                I bring this to the work: PhD in Chinese Medicine (body as energy system). Evolutionary
                astrologer (reading soul contracts and Chiron placements). Death doula (holding space for
                loss and transformation). Hand-poke tattoo artist (permanent marking of initiation). And
                most importantly—fellow wounded healer who's walked Chiron's path.
            </p>

            <p>
                I don't offer this work from professional distance. I offer it from the authority of three
                shattering initiations. From a chart that predicted exactly these losses. From a Chiron
                placement that's transformed my wound into medicine.

        <blockquote>
            "Not everyone is called to be a wounded healer. But if you're here, if this resonates,
            if your loss feels like initiation—then Chiron is calling you."

            <h2>How We Work</h2>

            <p>
                We start with chart reading. Your Chiron placement. Your baby's chart. The soul contracts
                between you. We explore how this loss serves your soul's evolution. How your wound is
                preparing you to heal others (if you choose that path).
            </p>

            <p>
                Then we design memorial tattoo that marks your Chiron initiation. Maybe the Chiron symbol
                itself. Maybe your baby's astrological signature. Maybe imagery of wounding and healing.
                The design emerges from understanding the evolutionary purpose.
            </p>

                We time the tattoo ceremony cosmically—meaningful transits, Chiron aspects, your baby's
                dates. Hand-poke method. Sacred space. Witnessing your transformation from bereaved parent
                to wounded healer.

            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
                Wounded healers support each other. If money is the barrier, we'll find a way. Payment
                plans. Sliding scale. Some sessions as seva. Chiron doesn't care about your bank account—only
                whether you're ready to transform your wound into medicine.
