            <p>
                I'm Jessica. I've had three miscarriages, and each loss led me to ask: Why?
                Not in despair, but in genuine curiosity. What was the purpose of this pain?
            </p>
            <p>
                Evolutionary astrology gave me an answer. Your baby's chart—yes, even lost babies
                have birth charts—reveals their soul's brief mission. What they came to teach.
                How their short life serves your growth. The sacred agreement made before birth.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <p>
                I combine memorial tattoo work with evolutionary astrology. We read your baby's chart
                together. We understand the cosmic timing of their arrival and departure. We create
                permanent ink that honors both your grief AND the soul-level meaning of your loss.
            </p>

            <p>
                This isn't "everything happens for a reason" spiritual bypassing. Your baby's death is
                devastating. AND their soul came with purpose. Both can be true. Let me help you find
                the meaning without dismissing the pain.

            <h2>Common Questions</h2>

            <p>
                <strong>What if I don't know anything about astrology?</strong><br>
                Perfect. I explain everything clearly. You don't need astrology background—just openness
                to exploring your baby's life through this lens.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>What dates do you need?</strong><br>
                Birth date (for stillbirth/infant death), estimated conception date (for miscarriage),
                or loss date. Even approximate timing works for reading.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Is this religious?</strong><br>
                No. Evolutionary astrology is a psychological and spiritual framework, not a religion.
                It works alongside any faith tradition or no tradition.
            </p>

                <strong>What if I don't believe in astrology?</strong><br>
                That's okay. Many clients are curious but skeptical. We can do meaningful memorial work
                with or without the chart reading. Your choice entirely.

            <p>
                <strong>How long does chart reading take?</strong><br>
                60-90 minutes typically. We cover your baby's chart, soul contracts, cosmic timing,
                and how this informs memorial tattoo design.

            <h3>Jessica's Journey</h3>

            <p>
                After my three miscarriages, I sought answers everywhere. Evolutionary astrology was the
                framework that finally made sense—not in a "this makes it okay" way, but in a "this helps
                me understand the soul-level purpose" way.
            </p>

            <p>
                I studied evolutionary astrology deeply, learning to read charts through the lens of soul
                evolution. I discovered my own chart showed exactly these losses as initiatory experiences.
                My babies' souls agreed, before birth, to come briefly and prepare me for this work.
            </p>

            <p>
                Now I offer this to other bereaved parents: chart readings that explain the cosmic "why,"
                combined with memorial tattoos that make the soul contract permanent. I also bring PhD in
                Chinese Medicine (meridian wisdom), death doula training (holding space for loss), and
                hand-poke tattoo artistry (gentle, ceremonial method).
